One recommendation is to establish clear criteria for determining the authorship of AI-generated works.

As AI continues to advance and generate increasingly sophisticated works of art, questions surrounding authorship, ownership, and copyright protection will become more pressing. It is crucial for stakeholders in the art, technology, and legal industries to engage in dialogue and collaboration to address these challenges and ensure a fair and equitable copyright system for AI-generated images.\n",
