            "\u001b[1m\u001b[92m [DEBUG]: == [GDPR Expert] Task output: After searching the internet, it is clear that the American Privacy Rights Act (APRA) has some notable parallels to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Both laws aim to establish comprehensive data privacy laws that protect consumer data and privacy rights. The GDPR and the proposed APRA both grant individuals rights such as access, correction, and deletion of their personal data. Additionally, both regulations emphasize the importance of obtaining explicit consent from individuals before collecting, processing, or sharing their personal information. The APRA would rival the GDPR and become one of the leading global privacy standards if passed.\n",
